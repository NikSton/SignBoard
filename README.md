# SignBoard
*** WORKS ONLY DARKRP ***

This entity replaces our old textscreen.

Suitable for decorating stores and much more.

Works on versions starting from 2.5.

How do I add it to F4?:

DarkRP.createEntity("Signboard",{
ent = "signboard",
model = "models/hunter/plates/plate025x025.mdl",
price = 10,
max = 3,
cmd = "buysignboard",
category = "Other",
})
